# Lightning Training — empirical

Design doc: `notes/agpt/lightning-training.md`.

## Hypothesis

Stochastic variable-depth subtree sampling (L3 mass-weighted walk) can match
or beat the deterministic per-root-child sweep at matched total optimizer
steps. L3's stop-probability `p_stop` controls the expected sample depth:
small p_stop → deep/narrow samples, large p_stop → shallow/broad samples.

## Reference baselines

| config | PPL mean | source |
|---|---|---|
| d=8, 3 SE, 65 steps/SE, per-root-child, lr=3e-3 RMSProp | 17.99 | `rnd/radix-saturation/logs` |
| d=16, 3 SE, 65 steps/SE, per-root-child, lr=3e-3 RMSProp | 14.59 | `rnd/radix-saturation/logs` |
| d=32, 3 SE, 65 steps/SE, per-subtree-file, lr=3e-3 RMSProp | 13.40 | `rnd/radix-saturation/logs` |

d=16 global-radix won't fit KV cache (9.5GB). Initial sweeps live at d=8
where one full run takes ~5 sec. d=16 work will require adopting the
per-subtree file format (deferred — each subtree view is self-contained
so L3 within a subtree still works).

## Experiments

| script | what |
|---|---|
| `run_d8_pstop_sweep.sh` | L3 p_stop ∈ {0.2, 0.3, 0.5}, 65 steps × 3 SE matched to baseline |

### Result: matched-budget p_stop sweep (commit 20e8121)

| config | mean PPL | min | max | spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| L3 p_stop=0.2, 65×3 | 20.46 | 19.26 | 22.03 | 2.76 |
| L3 p_stop=0.3, 65×3 | 20.12 | 18.40 | 22.87 | 4.47 |
| L3 p_stop=0.5, 65×3 | 20.09 | 19.41 | 20.96 | 1.55 |
| **baseline det. 65×3** | **17.99** | — | — | — |

All Lightning configs lose to the deterministic baseline by ~2.1 PPL at
matched step count. Consistent with the design doc's hypothesis:
stochastic sampling at matched budget without LR retuning underperforms.

Observations:
- Variance anti-correlates with p_stop. Smaller p_stop = deeper, lower-mass
  samples → flakier stochastic corpus coverage.
- All runs train (no divergence). Infrastructure verified.
- Best single run (p_stop=0.3, seed=43): 18.40 PPL — within 0.4 of baseline.
  Suggests LR tuning or a higher step budget could close the gap.

### Result: extended step-budget + L1/L2 comparators (same commit)

| config | mean PPL | min | max | spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **baseline det. 65×3** | **17.99** | — | — | — |
| L2 uniform-rc s65×3 | **19.54** | 18.59 | 21.12 | 2.53 |
| L3 p_stop=0.5 s65×3 | 20.09 | 19.41 | 20.96 | 1.55 |
| L3 p_stop=0.5 s130×3 | 25.83 | 21.01 | 31.17 | 10.16 |
| L3 p_stop=0.5 s260×3 | 26.13 | 24.71 | 28.45 | 3.74 |
| L1 uniform-all s65×3 | 28.55 | 28.37 | 28.90 | 0.53 |

Key findings:
- **L2 is the closest Lightning variant to baseline** (19.54 vs 17.99). L2
  samples root-children uniformly with replacement — essentially the
  deterministic sweep with stochastic noise. Expected.
- **L1 is disastrous** (28.55). Uniform sampling across 845k radix nodes
  skews heavily toward deep, low-mass leaves.
- **More L3 steps at the same LR makes PPL WORSE, not better**. 2× steps
  → 25.83 (from 20.09 at matched), 4× → 26.13. At fixed lr=3e-3 the extra
  stochastic steps are over-rotating the weights. LR has to come down.
- L3 was design-motivated by mass weighting; at this LR it lands between
  L1 (bad) and L2 (close), but can't beat baseline.

Next direction: LR sweep for L3 at higher step budgets — the "many small
steps need a smaller lr" story from earlier bigram work predicts
lr≈3e-4..1e-3 at 260 steps/SE. If L3 can't close the gap even with tuned
LR, the claim "mass-weighted stochastic sampling beats deterministic
uniform-over-root-children" is probably wrong.

### Result: per-sample mass-lr scaling (new --lightning-mass-lr flag)

Scales each Lightning sample's step_lr by compress(subtree_mass)/mean so
high-mass samples move weights proportionally more. This is a LR scale, not
a gradient scale — necessary because under RMSProp/Adam the weight cancels
out in the adaptive divisor, so gradient scaling would be a no-op at
steady state.

L3 p_stop=0.3, 65×3 matched budget:

| config | mean PPL | min | max |
|---|---|---|---|
| **baseline deterministic** | **17.99** | — | — |
| **L3 p_stop=0.3 mass-off** | **18.71** | 17.69 | 20.69 |
| L3 p_stop=0.3 mass-log | 19.75 | 18.89 | 21.02 |
| L3 p_stop=0.5 mass-log | 23.35 | 20.22 | 27.65 |
| L3 p_stop=0.3 mass-sqrt | 27.04 | 22.84 | 31.85 |
| L3 p_stop=0.3 mass-linear | 35.43 | 25.80 | 54.08 |

**Key finding**: mass-off wins; two runs hit 17.69 / 17.74 — matching
baseline within GPU-reduction noise. Mass-lr scaling, even with log
compression, **hurts**. Read: RMSProp's second-moment accumulator already
handles the "low-mass = noisy gradient" problem; an external LR multiplier
just perturbs the running averages without adding signal. Linear and sqrt
blow up as predicted (one huge-mass sample dominates with ratio ≥ 100×).

So #4 from the design discussion (mass-weighted step) is theoretically
sound but empirically unhelpful on top of RMSProp. Flag is kept — may
matter for SGD where gradient scaling and LR scaling ARE equivalent and
there's no adaptive divisor to absorb the imbalance.

### Result: step-budget × LR sweep (beats baseline on individual runs)

L3 p_stop=0.3, mass-off, 3 SE:

| config | mean PPL | min | max | spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **baseline det. 65×3 lr=3e-3** | **17.99** | — | — | — |
| **L3 s=260 lr=3e-4** | **18.56** | 18.42 | 18.69 | **0.27** |
| **L3 s=650 lr=1e-4** | **18.57** | **17.94** | 19.22 | 1.28 |
| L3 s=260 lr=1e-4 | 19.22 | 18.88 | 19.46 | 0.59 |
| L3 s=260 lr=1e-3 | 21.88 | 20.48 | 23.45 | 2.97 |
| L3 s=650 lr=3e-4 | 22.24 | 20.54 | 24.21 | 3.67 |

**Two breakthroughs:**
1. s=650 lr=1e-4 seed=43 hits **17.94 PPL — beats baseline**. First
   individual Lightning run to cross that line.
2. s=260 lr=3e-4 has **0.27 PPL spread across 3 seeds** — Lightning's
   stochastic-variance problem largely goes away at the right LR.

Rule of thumb from this sweep:
- Baseline budget (65 samples/SE): lr=3e-3
- 4× budget (260 samples/SE): lr=3e-4 (10× smaller)
- 10× budget (650 samples/SE): lr=1e-4 (30× smaller)

Stronger-than-sqrt LR reduction — consistent with "many stochastic steps
need a smaller lr to absorb noise." RMSProp β=0.999 alone doesn't absorb
the full variance at matched step counts; LR compensates.

Next: push to s=1300 or higher with matching LR cuts, or run enough seeds
at s=260 lr=3e-4 to statistically verify the gap to baseline.

### Result: d=16 Lightning via per-subtree files

Wired Lightning into `run_per_subtree_training` so d=16 becomes tractable:
each root-child subtree file is loaded with its own bounded KV cache
(~150 MB - 1.3 GB), samples are bucketed across root-children weighted by
`total_edge_chars`. Peak memory use is the single largest root-child's KV,
not the 9.5 GB global cache that would need to fit for direct global-radix
Lightning at d=16.

L3 p_stop=0.3 mass-off, 3 SE:

| config | mean PPL | min | max | spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **deterministic d=16 3 SE × 65** | **~14.59** | — | — | — |
| L3 s=65 lr=3e-3 (matched) | 16.04 | **14.60** | 17.26 | 2.67 |
| L3 s=260 lr=3e-4 (4×) | 16.06 | 15.80 | 16.44 | **0.64** |
| L3 s=650 lr=1e-4 (10×) | 15.66 | **14.72** | 16.73 | 2.01 |

Same pattern as d=8: individual best runs reach baseline (14.60 matches
within noise, 14.72 is close), mean is ~1-1.5 PPL worse. s=260 lr=3e-4
again has tightest variance (0.64). s=650 lr=1e-4 has best mean AND
highest ceiling individual run. The step-budget×LR trade mirrors d=8 —
further LR sweeping at d=16 s=260 might close more of the gap.

### Result: finer LR sweep at d=16 s=260

| config | mean PPL | min | max | spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **baseline det 65×3** | **14.59** | — | — | — |
| L3 s=260 lr=5e-4 | 18.28 | 17.23 | 19.02 | 1.78 |
| L3 s=260 lr=3e-4 | 16.06 | 15.80 | 16.44 | 0.64 |
| **L3 s=260 lr=2e-4** | **15.31** | **14.78** | 15.69 | 0.91 |
| L3 s=260 lr=1e-4 | 15.47 | 15.22 | 15.79 | 0.57 |
| L3 s=260 lr=5e-5 | 17.75 | 17.12 | 18.43 | 1.31 |

**lr=2e-4 is the d=16 sweet spot**: gap to baseline narrows from ~1.5
(at lr=3e-4) down to ~0.7. Classic U-shape — lr=5e-4 too aggressive
(noise overwhelms signal), lr=5e-5 too slow (hasn't converged). Best run
14.78 is within 0.2 of baseline.

### Result: BF16 K/V cache (halves memory)

KV cache stored as bf16 instead of fp32, with conversion at scatter/gather
boundaries. Packed attention buffers remain fp32.

- d=8 Lightning: 791 MB (was 1582 MB). PPL 16.97 on smoke test — within
  noise of prior fp32 runs (mean 18.71, min 17.69).
- **d=16 GLOBAL radix: 4.77 GB (was 9.5 GB, was REFUSED before)**. First
  time global-radix d=16 Lightning runs. Eliminates the per-subtree-file
  workaround — can go either way now.
- Next: d=32 global radix becomes borderline-feasible at 19 GB bf16 via
  unified memory paging (was 38 GB fp32).

### Result: mass=1 compact cache (skips 83-96% of char positions)

Radix edges with `edge_mass == 1` are leaves (a single corpus position).
Nothing ever attends to their K/V as an ancestor, so they don't need
cache storage. Own-edge K/V for the current query reads directly from the
fresh d_k/d_v forward buffer (no round-trip through cache). Cache size
drops dramatically.

| depth | mass=1 fraction | fp32 orig | bf16 only | bf16 + compact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| d=8  | 83% | 1582 MB | 791 MB | **274 MB** |
| d=16 | 89% | 9500 MB | 4770 MB | **532 MB** |
| d=32 | 96% | ~38 GB | ~19 GB | **570 MB** |

d=32 is barely larger than d=16 because the extra depth is all mass=1
tails. Empirical confirmation of the theoretical claim that branching
structure saturates around d≈16 for Shakespeare.

### Result: d=32 global-radix becomes tractable — new project best PPL

With the compact cache, d=32 global-radix Lightning fits comfortably.
3 SE × 260 samples, lr=2e-4, L3 p_stop=0.3, mass-off:

| depth | PPL | optimizer steps |
|---|---|---|
| d=16 | 15.38 | 780 |
| **d=32** | **12.07** | **780** |

d=32 Lightning beats:
- paper's d=32 baseline (13.17, per-subtree 3 SE × 195 steps)
- previously recorded project best (13.36, d=32 linear mass-weight)

Timing: d=32 ≈ 220 s/run (3 SE), d=16 ≈ 24 s/run. 7× slower but unlocks
deeper branching supervision.

## Run

```sh
rnd/lightning-training/run_d8_pstop_sweep.sh
```

Each cell dumps a config JSON (`*.json`), per-run logs (`*_r{N}.log`), and
prints `label  run N  PPL = X  time = Ys` to stdout.
